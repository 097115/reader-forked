reader
------

A minimal command line reader offering better readability of web pages on the
CLI.

![reader](demo.gif)

`reader` parses a web page for its actual content and displays it in nicely
highlighted text on the command line. In addition, `reader` renders embedded
images from that page as colored block-renders on the terminal as well.


## Usage

```sh
reader https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/superhighway84/
